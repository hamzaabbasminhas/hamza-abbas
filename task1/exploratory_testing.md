## Usability Improvements & Suggestions

### UI-IMP-01: Confusing Display in "Budget Mode"  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Charter:** C-06  
**Description:** When Budget Mode is enabled, the central chart replaces "Total Income" with "Budget", removing key income-expense insight.  
**Suggestion:** Redesign chart to accommodate all three: Income, Expenses, and Budget, or allow toggling views.

### UI-IMP-02: Missing Search Functionality in Currency List  
**Severity:** Low  
**Charter:** C-05  
**Description:** No search in long list of currencies. User must scroll manually.  
**Suggestion:** Add search input at top of list.

### UI-IMP-03: Inconsistent Rounding in Percentages  
**Severity:** Low  
**Charter:** C-03  
**Description:** Dashboard pie chart percentages sometimes don’t sum to 100% (e.g., 99% or 101%).  
**Suggestion:** Use robust rounding algorithm like Largest Remainder Method.

### UI-IMP-04: No Confirmation Before Deleting Transaction  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Charter:** C-03  
**Description:** Deleting sensitive entries happens instantly without prompt.  
**Suggestion:** Add confirmation modal before deletion.

### UI-IMP-05: Missing Labels for Expense Category Icons  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Charter:** C-02 / C-05  
**Description:** Icons on home screen have no labels, forcing users to guess or memorize categories.  
**Suggestion:** Add text labels or tooltips for clarity.

## Risks

### 🔐 Data Integrity Risk – HIGH
Incorrect handling of currency exchange can show misleading balances and affect trust.

### 💳 Usability & Abandonment Risk – MEDIUM
If budget mode or category icons are unclear, users may churn due to poor UX.

### 🧾 Vendor Lock-In Risk – MEDIUM
If export/backup is premium-locked or error-prone, users cannot safely migrate data.

### 🔐 Security & Privacy Risk – HIGH
App stores and processes sensitive financial data. Requires encryption, authentication, and GDPR compliance.
